  "summary": "Implemented a dedicated /admin/login two-step admin access flow (Internet Identity login then admin passkey verification calling backend authenticateAdmin), added an admin session flag persisted in sessionStorage, updated admin route guarding to redirect to the login screen with returnPath, and added logic to clear the admin session on logout and on Unauthorized errors in some admin API hooks. Also introduced enquiry confirm/reject placeholder hooks not requested.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added placeholder admin enquiry confirm/reject mutations that simulate work then throw 'not yet implemented' errors.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly lists implementing enquiry confirm/reject backend support as a non-goal, and these new hooks are unrelated to unlocking admin access.",
